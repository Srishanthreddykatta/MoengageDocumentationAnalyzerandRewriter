Signing up with MoEngage is the essential first step to unlock MoEngage's features, like personalized customer messaging and automated marketing campaigns. You'll need to create a new account, a one-time task, based on your organization's size and how you plan to use MoEngage for marketing.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You'll need a subscription code to access MoEngage. This code confirms your account is active. Contact your sales representative at MoEngage to obtain your subscription code.

#### Using a Password {#using-a-password}

To create a new account using a password, follow these steps:

1.  In the Company name (Workspace name) box, type your company name or workspace name. This will be the name of your account in the MoEngage dashboard, which is called a workspace.
2.  In the Work email box, type your work email.
3.  In the Password box, type your password. Ensure the password meets the following criteria:

    *   Contains 8 to 20 characters.
    *   Contains one capital letter.
    *   Contains one number.
    *   Contains one special character among !@#$%^&*()_?/,<>;:{}|~ and no space.
4.  In the Subscription code box, type your subscription code.
5.  Select the I agree to the Terms of use and Privacy policy check box.
6.  Click Get Started.
    You are directed to the following page. MoEngage sends an email to your registered email address for verification.

If you have not received an email to activate your account, click Resend Verification Email.

Open the email you received from MoEngage and click the [link](your-verification-link-here) to activate your account. After the verification, you'll go to the login page for your MoEngage account, which we call your 'dashboard'. This is where you'll manage all your MoEngage activity.

MoEngage uses an extra security step to protect your account. You'll need to set up an "authenticator app" on your phone or computer. Don't worry, it's a one-time setup!
