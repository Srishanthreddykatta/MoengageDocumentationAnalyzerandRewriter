Information
MoEngage adds an extra layer of security to your account using 2-step verification. This helps protect your information from unauthorized access by requiring a second verification step during login. MoEngage enables 2-step verification by default to protect your account from unauthorized access using an authenticator app. When you try to log in, MoEngage prompts you to set up 2-step verification. You must configure a one-time verification setup on your device to proceed with login. For more information, refer to Set Up 2-Step Verification on Your Device.
